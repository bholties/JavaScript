 Automatic Table and Date Search 


 Write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.


Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.


Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
